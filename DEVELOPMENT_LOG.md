# Evothesis Development Log

## Project Overview
Evothesis is a data-as-a-service analytics platform that captures comprehensive website behavioral data and exports it directly to client S3 buckets. The platform prioritizes complete data ownership, privacy compliance, and vendor independence over traditional dashboard-based analytics.

## Business Model Evolution
**Original Model (Deprecated):** SaaS analytics platform with built-in dashboards
**Current Model:** Data-as-a-service with VM-per-client deployment

- **VM-per-Client Deployment:** Dedicated infrastructure for each client/agency
- **Multi-Site Support:** Single pixel tracks unlimited domains per client
- **Usage-Based Pricing:** Billing based on unique domains detected automatically
- **Complete Data Ownership:** Raw events exported to client S3 buckets
- **No Analytics Lock-in:** Clients build their own dashboards from exported data

## Current Project Status

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Remove Analytics Processing?

1. **Faster Time-to-Market:** Eliminates complex ETL development
2. **Client Flexibility:** Raw data allows custom analytics approaches
3. **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer failure points and maintenance overhead
4. **Data Ownership:** Complete client control over data processing
5. **Business Model Alignment:** Focuses on data export, not analytics dashboards

### Why VM-per-Client?

1. **Data Isolation:** Complete client data separation
2. **Compliance:** Easier GDPR/HIPAA compliance with isolated infrastructure
3. **Customization:** Per-client configuration and scaling
4. **Billing Simplicity:** Clear usage attribution per client
5. **Enterprise Appeal:** Dedicated infrastructure for premium pricing

### Why S3 Export Focus?

1. **Data Ownership:** Clients control their data completely
2. **Integration Flexibility:** Compatible with any analytics platform
3. **Vendor Independence:** No lock-in to Evothesis analytics
4. **Scalability:** S3 handles unlimited data volume
5. **Cost Efficiency:** No expensive analytics infrastructure

## Business Model Implementation

### Pricing Strategy
- **Small Business:** $199/month (1M pageviews, unlimited domains)
- **Growth Business:** $499/month (10M pageviews, unlimited domains)  
- **Enterprise:** $999/month (100M pageviews, unlimited domains)
- **Overages:** $10 per 100K additional pageviews
- **HIPAA Compliance:** +$1,500/month with BAA

### Auto-Billing Logic
```python
# Domain discovery triggers billing adjustment
def handle_new_domain(site_id, client_id):
    if site_id not in client_domains[client_id]:
        client_domains[client_id].append(site_id)
        trigger_billing_webhook(client_id, new_domain=site_id)
        
# Usage monitoring for overage billing
def calculate_monthly_usage(client_id, month):
    total_pageviews = count_pageviews(client_id, month)
    plan_limit = get_client_plan_limit(client_id)
    if total_pageviews > plan_limit:
        overage = total_pageviews - plan_limit
        overage_charge = (overage / 100000) * 10  # $10 per 100K
        trigger_overage_billing(client_id, overage_charge)
```

### Client Onboarding Process
1. **VM Provisioning:** Automated client VM deployment
2. **S3 Configuration:** Client provides bucket credentials
3. **Pixel Deployment:** Client adds tracking script to websites
4. **Domain Discovery:** System automatically detects tracked domains
5. **Export Verification:** Confirm S3 exports are successful
6. **Billing Activation:** Start usage monitoring and billing
